    "This interactive 🎈Streamlit example introduces you to Machine Learning in Python on ❄️Snowflake:",
     "\n\n - ✅ At the end of this demo, you will be able to build a simple, end to end ML workflow in Python from ingestion to a dynamic interface you can use to predict diamond prices. You will be using [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the classic [Diamonds dataset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html).",
     "\n\n - 💡 You can run this example inside a [Snowflake Notebook](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks) or a [classic Jypyter Notebook on your machine](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/build-code-using-snowpark-notebook/). You will build an interactive application using 🎈 [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) at the end.",
    "\n\n - 👉 If you prefer to download the code to run on your own, just clone or fork this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowflake-ml-for-python/)."
